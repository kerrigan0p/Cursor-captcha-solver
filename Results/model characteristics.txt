The best model provided here has been trained for 100 epochs with an initial learning rate of 1e-2.
This learning rate was halved every 20 epochs and achieved an average pixel error of 11 pixels.
This error does not affect captcha validation, so we consider this model sufficient for deployment in production.
Across the entire evaluation/test set of 252 captchas, it has never produced an invalid coordinate.
